# Personal_Game_Project_1_Touch

A personal game project in Unity.

Not for commercial use, the particle effects is from internet.

I made it in the GIGA game jam for 48h(2023/7/7-2023/7/9).

There are 5 people in the team, most of them are students. 2 2D-artist, 1 programmer, 1 musician, 1 level designer.

Because of the copyright, I remove the odin inspector plugin, you can get it from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/utilities/odin-inspector-and-serializer-89041

Because of the copyright, I remove the dialog system plugin, you can get it from https://assetstore.unity.com/packages/tools/behavior-ai/dialogue-system-for-unity-11672

downland the package above, and drag into the project, then it will work.
